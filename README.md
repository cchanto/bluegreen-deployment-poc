How Does a Blue/Green Deployment Process Work
The main prerequisite for a blue/green deployment is having two identical production environments, with a router, load balancer, or service mesh that can switch traffic between them. 

The blue/green deployment process works as follows:

Deploy new version—deploy the new (green) version alongside the current (blue) version. Test it to ensure it works as expected, and deploy changes to it if needed.
Switch over traffic—when the new version is ready, switch overall traffic from blue to green. This should be done seamlessly so end-users aren’t interrupted.
Monitor—closely monitor how users interact with the new version and watch out for errors and issues.
Deploy or rollback—if there is a problem, immediately roll back by switching traffic back to the blue version. Otherwise, keep traffic on the green version and continue using it. The green version now becomes the blue (current) version, and a new version can be deployed alongside it as the “new green” version.
